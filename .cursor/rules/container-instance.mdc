Docker Environment Rules:

1. Folder Structure
   - Always use docker/dev/ and docker/prod/ folders
   - Never place Docker files in root directory
   - Keep all environment-specific configurations in respective folders

2. Docker Compose Files
   - Never add 'version' attribute in docker-compose.yml
   - Place in docker/dev/docker-compose.yml
   - Place in docker/prod/docker-compose.yml
   - Use environment-specific configurations

3. Environment Separation
   - Keep dev and prod configurations completely separate
   - Use different environment variables per environment
   - Maintain separate Dockerfiles if needed
   - Use appropriate naming conventions per environment
